# Dart Binary Search
## Introduction
This repo contains the implementation of binary search in dart. Fork and test if you are Interested too!!
Hey everyone, I have implemented the binary search in here using dart. You can download the dart sdk from [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart). This repo is solely for the purpose of learning dart(without touching Flutter anywhere). There is deficiency of comments in the files so you can add that. XD

You can run the main file by running the command `dart main.dart` in the linux terminal(if you use linux or wsl)and see the output.

## Some Questions To Try Out
1. Try making the `locate_card_new` function without the `if` statement before the `while` loop?
2. Try changing the `locate_card_new` to `locate_card` in the main function in the `main.dart` file. Can use explain why it is giving null in edge case number x?
3. Edit `locate_card` to pass all the edge cases and try adding and testing it on any new edge case (if you could think of any new).
